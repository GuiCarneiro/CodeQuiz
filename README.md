=============

An app to train mental calculation.

You will need Kivy to run this application. See http://kivy.org/ for more information.
A guide on how to install Kivy can be found here: http://kivy.org/docs/installation/installation.html

Although it should run on all common platforms, it is optimised for android screens in portrait mode.

This is work in progress, feedback is very welcome.
